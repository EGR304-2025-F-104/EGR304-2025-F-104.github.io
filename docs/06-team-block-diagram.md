## Design Objectives

* Allow the user to select a desired temperature from within the comfort (and warmth) of their own home
* Have a function that automatically turns the heating pad on and off based on the environmental temperature to melt ice without draining electricity continuously
* Utilize Audio/Visual communication to assist the user in interacting with the product
